This contains files and report of my mini project based on "SIMPLE INDEXING ON SALES RECORDS"

# ABSTRACT
This project titled “SIMPLE INDEXING FOR SALES RECORDS” has been done using Eclipse IDE with the platform Windows and language Java.The database used for the project is ‘Sales’ records.
The project mainly focuses on building the index for the records which is fed in CSV format file ,then various operations with a menu choice is displayed to the end user, such as Insert ,Search ,Delete and Modify.
For the purpose of searching efficiently,binary search algorithm is being used.The inserted record will be initially packed and then will be put in the record file.The user can also Unpack all the records in the file which will be displayed.
The index files generated comprises of a key value and its respective position in the record file.This position will be used for various operations.
So,Indexing is a ‘way to optimize the performance of file access by minimizing the number of disk accesses required to process the required data’.folder
